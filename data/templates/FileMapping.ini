; This file serves as a template used by the build system to generate a mapping file
; passed on to *MakeAppx.exe* to control which artifacts go into the final .appx package,
; and how they are named.
;
; Each line describes a pair of file paths in quotation marks, separated by either spaces
; or tabs, where the left-hand side names the local (on disk) location, and the right-hand
; side designates the .appx-relative path name.
;
; The build system uses this template to generate the final *FileMapping.ini* file when
; building a target. Clients can adjust this file to control .appx package contents.
;
; With several artifacts being generated by the build system into configuration-specific
; locations, the following placeholders are supported to allow writing a generic template:
;
; Left-hand side:
; * $target_dir$: The local path where artifacts are generated into.
; * $cargo_package_root$: The root directory of the cargo package.
; * $executable$: File name of the executable image.
;
; Righ-hand side:
; * $file_name$: The file name (without a path) derived from the left-hand side after
;                expansion.
